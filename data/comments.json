            "en": "<p>Salutations Mattia, </p><p>Following our conversation, I will transcribe this marginal anecdote, but before, I think it makes sense to refer that my initial instinct (some might say this is due to my profession) was to draw a poster from the “Esboço para cartaz para a conferência sobre o Anti-globo” [Sketch for poster for the conference about the Anti-globe] (fig. 54) — a contribution that would feel as if I was renouncing as a form a-gent*. </p><p>Ultimately, I abandoned that idea and grabbed (or meta-grabbed, as the work is digitalized) a manual of the end of the 18th Century — <i>La Magie blanche dévoilée</i> [White Magic Revealed] —, a book on demystified magic written by Henri Descremps, a magician amongst other things. I got to know the work of this author in a workshop at the Toulouse Art and Design Institute where I challenged a group of students to search for their Carl Sagan (that preferably had passed away more than a century). A group of students presented me with a bibliography in which this manual stood out because it had an English version. In its list of tricks, I could find the Dancing Egg, the Philosophical Mushroom, The Fortune-teller Baguette and the Illusion of the Dove Decapitated by the Cut on its Shadow. The author of this last one was called Theophrastus Paracelsus, the pseudonym of a famous charlatan magician and professor that Descremps wanted to expose at any cost. </p><p>It was customary to add at the end of this type of manual, a section of intricate anecdotes and charades to give it a bit more volume. The English version, published by one Charles Stalker, ends abruptly leaving this section out. But in the French edition we see Descremps reveal himself as an astute narrator creating two fictitious characters — M. Hill and M. Van-Estin —, a couple of stooges like Bouvard et Pécuchet, that will dismantle a series of new <i>tours de passe-passe</i> [sleight of hand tricks], automaton and enigmas. The book ends with a final logogryph. This kind of long poem, annotated with scientific facts, was built from a Latin text, and it was destined to the reader to decrypt and reveal the magic word. A good magician does not leave his art on the wrong hands, so, the word was written using invisible ink on the last page of the book block, but it could only be revealed by making the page moist, a procedure that was chemically limited to three attempts, at the end of which it stops working. </p><p>I include the jay-peg of this sheet where almost paradoxically we read in a margin note, “check erratum”, nonexistent in the document. I recommend making the page moist on Photoshop: the word “Mirage” or “Fromage” will come up (my palaeographic vision of French needs some practice so it’s very possible that it is some other word). At last, the only thing left to say is that I stumbled upon two links on the site that were swapped, on table G: when we lean forward to better scrutinize the reflection on the visor of a space suit we encounter a man smoking a cigarette contemplating something above him. A fortuitous meeting. And by the way, the recipe for this ink is included in the book and it does not involve lemon juice.</p><p>Yours <br/>A MSSG<br/></p><p>—</p><p>Translators note: <br/>* <i>a-gente</i> in the original Portuguese, plays with the words “gente”, people in English and “agente”, agent in English. This double meaning is lost in the English translation, although it gains a different one, “gent” as in gentleman.</p><figure><img src=\"images/on8diiZVaz1ufstie_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"images/on8diiJZdB1ufstie_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\"/></figure>",
            "pt": "<p>Salvé Mattia,</p><p>Na sequência da nossa conversa, transcrevo esta anedota marginal, mas antes, creio que faz sentido referir que o meu impulso inicial (alguns chamam a isto defeito profissional) era desenhar um cartaz a partir do “Esboço para cartaz para a conferência sobre o Anti-globo” (fig. 54) — seria uma contribuição em jeito de renúncia à minha condição de a-gente da forma. </p><p>Por fim abandonei essa ideia e lancei mão (ou <i>meta-mão</i>, uma vez que a obra é digitalizada) a um manual do final do séc. XVIII — <i>La Magie blanche dévoilée</i> —, um livro de magia desmistificada escrito por Henri Descremps, um mágico entre outras coisas. Conheci a obra deste autor num workshop no Instituto de Artes e Design de Toulouse onde desafiei um conjunto de alunos a procurar o seu Carl Sagan (de preferência falecido há mais de um século). Um grupo de alunas apresentou-me a bibliografia onde este manual sobressaía por ter uma versão traduzida para o inglês. Na lista de truques que revelava encontrava-se o Ovo Dançante, o Cogumelo Filosófico, a <i>Baguette</i> Divinatória e a Ilusão da Pomba Decapitada Pelo Corte da sua Sombra. O autor desta última chamava-se Teofrasto Paracelso, o pseudónimo de um famoso mágico e professor charlatão que Descremps pretendia desmascarar a todo o custo.</p><p>Era costume acrescentar no final deste tipo de manuais uma secção de anedotas intrincadas e charadas para compor melhor o volume. A versão inglesa, publicada por um Charles Stalker, termina abruptamente deixando de fora esta secção. É na edição francesa que vemos Descremps revelar-se como um astuto narrador criando dois personagens fictícios — M. Hill e M. Van-Estin —, uma dupla de estarolas tipo Bouvard et Pécuchet, que vão desmontar uma série de novos <i>tours de passe-passe</i>, autómata, enigmas e logogrifos. O livro termina com um logogrifo final. Esta espécie de poema extenso e anotado com factos científicos foi construído a partir de um texto em latim, e destinava-se ao leitor para que este o desencriptasse revelando uma palavra mágica. Ora, como um bom mágico não deixa a sua arte em mãos alheias, a palavra estava escrita numa tinta invisível na última folha do miolo, mas esta só se podia desvendar humedecendo a página, um procedimento que está quimicamente limitado a três turnos, ao fim dos quais deixa de funcionar.\n  </p><p>Incluo o jotapegue desta folha onde quase paradoxalmente lemos numa marginália “a ver na errata” inexistente no documento. Recomendo humedecer a imagem no Photoshop: aparecerá a palavra “<i>Mirage</i>” ou “<i>Fromage</i>” (a minha visão paleográfica do francês precisa de mais treino e é bem possível ser outra coisa). Por fim, resta só dizer que tropecei em dois links trocados no site, na mesa G: quando nos debruçamos para melhor escrutinar um reflexo na viseira de um escafandro espacial damos com um homem a fumar um cigarro em contemplação de qualquer coisa que está acima dele. É mesmo um encontro fortuito. E já agora, a receita para esta tinta está incluída no livro e não envolve sumo de limão. </p><p>um abraço <br/>A MSSG<br/></p><figure><img src=\"images/on8diiZVaz1ufstie_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"images/on8diiJZdB1ufstie_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\"/></figure>"

In <em>French Defence</em>, one of the most basic and solid openings, lines are created where pawns make their way forward. In a drawing, white areas are changed, spreading lines and blots, which can either cross (scheme) or occupy distinct and untouchable areas (weave), but always changing white available surfaces.</p><p>Chess implies the perpetuity of each piece, turned to stone in its eternal shape: a pawn is a pawn, a castling is a castling, a queen is a queen. Information is always complete whichever the state. This way it becomes possible the cartography, and memorizing of the several expected patterns of states, of each defence, evasion and attack. “To Plan”, <em>i.e.</em>, liable to be displayed and reduced to pencil drawings on a two-dimensional surface, in which traces are once again reinterpreted by semiotic observation: <em>etiam</em>, “drawing”. Plan of war, performance, installation. Art when returning to <em>techné</em>.</p><p>Only relative movements of pieces inside the closed space of the board determine the immediate usefulness, employment and function of the piece, until the moment of its elimination and ulterior recovery, in a new positioning (reset). The occupation of the topology of the smooth and white sheet of paper by several graphite and chromatic territories does not allow the return to a primitive and pristine state. But the redistribution of these scratched papers in several closed, flat surfaces, and offered to the horizontal gaze (<em>etiam</em>, “table”) assure the potential of the constant weaving rotations.</p><p>In both cases, chess and drawing, the spatial placing (by pieces and blotches) implies a direction in time, also connected to human will (notwithstanding the degree of stochastic gestures, at random or distracted that can preside the action, the plan: in the aimed will, there is always room for strabismus, i.e., etymologically, gr, <em>strabizein</em>, “twist”).</p><p>The players of the immortal start enclose themselves in spaces apparently shut and controlled, with ruled paper and pens and chess clocks next to it, underlining the control of gestures. In turn, corridors, doors, corners, with transparent walls, made of glass or silk (<em>vide</em> mesh) spread, extend, intersect, where reflections, shadows and phantom, like witnesses, wander, not only as simply a lateral space (also closed), but in an oblique dimension to the ongoing games. They come up and leave with no notice.</p><p>The promise of quantum chess peeks through the crumbled hole on the wall, that would separate the dimensions. In that other game, the piece can be a pawn and a queen, each role layered until the moment of its actual movement: there it will move according to the function one gives it, the L of the horse or the long diagonals of the bishop, until it stops and it recovers the layering. The result is uncertain and only the moment’s savouring is a given fact. It’s in the momentary observation of the pieces and the multiple decisions in interpreting that happiness arises in the reading of the game and the drawings placed on the table.</p><p> A title opens a series, allowing a transversal jump between dimensions (tables), and hence other narratives and other combinations of the drawings. In weaving, the warp threads are stretched in parallel and longitudinal lines and then the threads are weaved in a woof, transversal, perpendicular, in zigzag. The reader creates readings in a woof, closed off in each singular table, at the same time, he carries the possibility of weaving outside the table, other alliances, or copulations. I was stuck in one of them and I don’t know how to play chess. I won’t make you say what you didn’t say, I will only say what I can see, incurring in the danger of only seeing what I can say.</p>",

You know that. <br/>— Less than one-tenth of the actual wave spectrum. What could we really see if we had access to the other 90%? Sam, we are virtually blind. All of us. You tell me that my eyes are perfect, well they are not. I’m blind all but a tenth of the universe. <br/>— My dear friend, only the God’s see everything. <br/>— My dear Doctor I`m closing in on the Gods.</i><br/>(Roger Corman, <i>X: The Man with X Rays Eyes</i>) </p><p>And because epigraphs don’t need any explanation, I now follow with some memories.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Recollection 1: My many visits to the eye hospital in Belo Horizonte during my childhood.</b></p><p>The never ending waiting, while sitting down beside a crowd of people that, like me, were visually debilitated to be sure. With the exception of a few earplugs or gauze over the eyes of thoses that shared the waiting room, I don’t recall anything special that would put that debilitation to light. But, ironically, the clinic was on the highest point of the city, beside a viewpoint where one could contemplate, like no other spot, the best view of the place that carried in its name the pride of its viewpoints [Belo Horizonte, literally Beautiful Horizon].</p><p>I don’t know how many times I went to that clinic, but there for the first time, I gained a feeling that would accompany me for a long time: that there was something wrong with me. This feeling became worse some time after that, when I started to go to the play therapy waiting room, which my parents thought I should go to after their separation.</p><p>Two sentences from the therapist, said during thoses visits, unite the waiting room experiences: according to her, my strabismus was due to the multiplicity of information I was submited to by my recently separated parents: while one would say yes, the other said no. That strabismus came up way before my parents ever separated didn’t seem to worry her. And that I had never thought of it, or even less about the fact that my parents, to my sadness, always agreed with everything, justifies of course the fact that I kept that memory with me for a long time.  </p><p>The other episode has a painting of a sunset at its centre. When seeing the small canvas that I had made, probably with all the royal blue paint tubes that were available, the therapist concluded that I missed my father. I thought that was the silliest thing I had ever heard: to have a separated father, and therefore guilty, seemed to me, at that time, the coolest thing that could happen to anyone. But after that, I started to hate sunsets, and I think that my rejection of the city of Belo Horizonte maybe is also related to that. </p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Recollection 2: The day I finally saw my strabismus.</b></p><p>My strabismus is, to me, an abstraction. I have not only, never seen myself as such, but also cannot identify strabismus in others. It was only after I started to get acquaited with Painting that in some way I found an image for strabismus. There are, for instance, some Van Gogh self-portraits where his eyes point to slightly different directions. You also can find this in Rembrandt. In truth, the directions of the eyes are not the only things that catch my attention, but the fact that one of them seems alive and focused while the other is lost. It’s as if one eye would face the canvas and the other was turned inside – a Chardin eye, perhaps.  </p><p>Later, talking about the strabismus of painters with artist friends, they have told me that maybe it wasn’t a question of patology but of process: to make a self-portrait the painter has his eye on two points: in the mirror and on the canvas. </p><p>To see less is then to see more: spaces and time are condensed.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>From recollections to findings:  </b></p><p>Recently, while reading about Robert Smithson and his work in Yucatan, I found a reference to an american traveller, John L. Stevens, that in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century made the same journey that Smithson would make 100 years after. Stevens would travel accompanied by a sketcher, responsible for ilustrating the journey, and a doctor, Dr. Cabot. During that expedition, Cabot, with the help of his travel companions, performed some cirurgies to correct the strabismus of the local population also showing the new medical advances to those “slow” people.</p><p>Mentioning strabismus and the cirurgies performed in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, still unstudied – that were made without any anesthesia, which the author, Jennifer L. Roberts, didn’t leave unnoticed – made sense in the picture she established for Smithson. For her, Smithson, specially in his works with mirrors and enantiomorphic mirrors, proposed the rehabilitation of a multifocal vision, in opposition to binocular, that would be in the origin of the illusion of unity and, therefore, of all the historical and perceptive framing of art since the renaissance.</p><p>“Why not reconstruct the inability to see?”, asks Smithson.</p><p>But it’s not about Smithson that I want to talk to you about, but of a passage in the text by Roberts, in which she tries to associate medical literature of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century about strabismus with Stephens impressions about the “slow” mentality of the Yucatan people. For Stephens the local population’s indiference with the Maya monuments gave out signs of being retarded in relation to “civilised” people.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>I copy here an excerpt by Roberts:</b></p><p><i>Stephens felt there were more strabics in Yucatan than elsewhere. More importantly however, the etiology of strabismus as discussed in contemporaneous medical treatises featured traits and behaviours that Stephens had already pejoratively attached to the Yucateans. For example, strabismus was strongly associated with mental incapacity because of the “dullness of look” it produced and the fact that it was often a sympton of neurological deseases and other cerebral irritations. It also suggested infantilism and lassitude (it was believed that the wandering eye could often be controlled by well disciplined patient willing to make the effort toward proper practice and education. (&hellip;) Consequently, when associated with an indigenous population and implicitly opposed civilized, industrious vision, strabismus could be made to signify not merely a visual disorder but also a cultural one – a culture unable to break out of an indolent parallax and perform the perspective functions of modern industrial civilization; a culture unable to manufacture the necessary perspective to differentiate its foreground from its background, its present from its past.</i> (Jennifer L. Roberts, <i>Mirror Travels – Robert Smithson and History</i>, p. 94)</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>I went after Stephens book and I didn’t find any moral reading there, associating strabismus to the way the Yucatan population understands the story. But I found the account of the cirurgies, with which I say goodbye, still with strabismus.</b></p><p><i>There is no immediate connexion between taking Daguerreotype portraits and the practice of surgery, but circumstances bring close together things entirely dissimilar in themselves, and we went from one to the other. Secluded as Merida is, and seldom visited by strangers, the fame of new discoveries in science is slow in reaching it, and the new operation of Mons. Guerin for the cure of strabismus had not been heard of. In private intercourse, we had spoken of this operation, and, in order to make it known, and extend its benefits, Doctor Cabot had offered to perform it in Merida. The Merida people have generally fine eyes, but, either because our attention was particularly directed to it, or that it is really the case, there seemed to be more squinting eyes, or biscos, as they are called, than are usually seen in any one town, and in Merida, as in some other places, this is not esteemed a beauty; but, either from want of confidence in a stranger, or a cheap estimation of the qualifications of a medico who asked no pay for his services, the doctor&rsquo;s philanthropic purposes were not appreciated. At least, no one cared to be the first; and as the doctor had no sample of his skill with him, no subject offered.</i></p><p><i>We had fixed the day for our departure; and the evening but one before, a direct overture was made to the doctor to perform the operation. The subject was a boy, and the application in his behalf was made by a gentleman who formed one of a circle in which we were in the habit of visiting, and whom “we were all happy to have it in our power to serve”.</i></p><p><i>The time was fixed at ten o'clock the next day. After breakfast, our sala was put in order for the reception of company, and the doctor for the first time looked to his instruments. He had some misgivings. They were of very fine workmanship, made in Paris, most sensitive to the influence of the atmosphere, and in that climate, it was almost impossible to preserve anything metallic from rust. The doctor had packed the case among his clothing in the middle of his trunk, and had taken every possible precaution, but, as usual upon such occasions, the most important instrument had rusted at the point, and in that state was utterly useless. There was no cutler in the place, nor any other person competent to touch it. Mr. Catherwood, however, brought out an old razor hone, and between them they worked off the rust.</i></p><p><i>At ten o'clock the doctor&rsquo;s subject made his appearance. He was the son of a widow lady of very respectable family, about fourteen years old, but small of stature, and presenting even to the most casual glance the stamp of a little gentleman. He had large black eyes, but, unluckily, their expression was very much injured by an inward squint. With the light heart of boyhood, however, he seemed indifferent to his personal appearance, and came, as he said, because his mother told him to do so. His handsome person, and modest and engaging manners, gave us immediately a strong interest in his favour. He was accompanied by the gentleman who had spoken of bringing him, Dr. Bado, a Guatimalian educated in Paris, the oldest and principal physician of Merida, and by several friends of the family, whom we did not know.</i></p><p><i>Preparations were commenced immediately. The first movement was to bring out a long table near the window; then to spread upon it a mattress and pillow, and upon these to spread the boy. Until the actual moment of operating, the precise character of this new business had not presented itself to my mind, and altogether it opened by no means so favourably as Daguerreotype practice. Not aiming to be technical, but desiring to give the reader the benefit of such scraps of learning as I pick up in my travels, modern science has discovered that the eye is retained in its orbit by six muscles, which pull it up and down, inward and outward, and that the undue contraction of either of these muscles produces that obliquity called squinting, which was once supposed to proceed from convulsions in childhood, or other unknown causes. The cure discovered is the cutting of the contracted muscle, by means of which the eye falls immediately into its proper place. This muscle lies under the surface; and, as it is necessary to pass through a membrane of the eye, the cutting cannot be done with a broadaxe or a handsaw. In fact, it requires a knowledge of the anatomy of the eye, manual dexterity, fine instruments, and Mr. Catherwood and myself for assistants.</i></p><p><i>Our patient remained perfectly quiet, with his little hands folded across his breast; but while the knife was cutting through the muscle he gave one groan, so piteous and heart-rending, that it sent into the next room all who were not immediately engaged. But before the sound of the groan had died away the operation was over, and the boy rose with his eye bleeding, but perfectly straight. A bandage was tied over it, and, with a few directions for its treatment, amid the congratulations and praises of all present, and wearing the same smile with which he had entered, the little fellow walked off to his mother.</i></p><p><i>The news of this wonder spread rapidly, and before night Dr. Cabot had numerous and pressing applications, among which was one from a gentleman whom we were all desirous to oblige, and who had this defect in both eyes.</i></p><p><i>On his account, we determined to postpone our departure another day; and, in furtherance of his original purpose, Dr. Cabot mentioned that he would perform the operation upon all who chose to offer. We certainly took no trouble to spread this notice, but the next morning, when we returned from breakfast, there was a gathering of squint-eyed boys around the door, who, with their friends and backers, made a formidable appearance, and almost obstructed our entrance. As soon as the door opened there was a rush inside; and as some of these slanting eyes might not be able to distinguish between meum and tuum, we were obliged to help their proprietors out into the street again.</i></p><p><i>At ten o'clock the big table was drawn up to the window, and the mattress and pillow were spread upon it, but there was such a gathering around the window that we had to hang up a sheet before it. Invitations had been given to Dr. Bado and Dr. Munoz, and all physicians who chose to come, and having met the governor in the evening, I had asked him to be present. These all honoured us with their company, together with a number of self-invited persons, who had introduced themselves, and could not well be turned out, making quite a crowded room.</i></p><p><i>The first who presented himself was a stout lad about nineteen or twenty, whom we had never seen or heard of before. Who he was or where he came from we did not know, but he was a bisco of the worst kind, and seemed able-bodied enough to undergo anything in the way of surgery. As soon as the doctor began to cut the muscle, however, our strapping patient gave signs of restlessness; and all at once, with an actual bellow, he jerked his head on one side, carried away the doctor&rsquo;s hook, and shut his eye upon it with a sort of lockjaw grip, as if determined it should never be drawn out. How my hook got out I have no idea; fortunately, the doctor let his go, or the lad&rsquo;s eye would have been scratched out. As it was, there he sat with the bandage slipped above one eye, and the other closed upon the hook, the handle of which stood out straight. Probably at that moment he would have been willing to sacrifice pride of personal appearance, keep his squint, and go through life with his eye shut, the hook in it, and the handle sticking out; but the instrument was too valuable to be lost. And it was interesting and instructive to a hook in his eye, and that of lookers-on who had not. All the spectators upbraided him with his cowardice and want of heart, and after a round of reproof to which he could make no answer, he opened his eye and let out the hook. But he had made a bad business of it. A few seconds longer, and the operation would have been completed. As it was, the whole work had to be repeated. As the muscle was again lifted under the knife, I thought I saw a glare in the eyeball that gave token of another fling of the head, but the lad was fairly browbeaten into quiet; and, to the great satisfaction of all, with a double share of blackness and blood, and with very little sympathy from any one, but with his eye straight, he descended from the table. Outside he was received with a loud shout by the boys, and we never heard of him again.</i></p><p><i>The room was now full of people, and, being already disgusted with the practice of surgery, I sincerely hoped that this exhibition would cure all others of a wish to undergo the operation, but a little present all the time, crept through the crowd, and, reaching the table, squinted up at us without speaking, his crisscross expression telling us very plainly what he wanted. He had on the usual Mestizo dress of cotton shirt and drawers and straw hat, and seemed so young, simple, and innocent, that we did not consider him capable of judging for himself. We told him he must not be operated on, but he answered, in a decided though modest tone, “Yo quiero, yo quiero,” “I wish it, I wish it.” We inquired if there was any one present who had any authority over him, and a man whom we had not noticed before, dressed, like him, in shirt and drawers, stepped forward and said he was the boy&rsquo;s father; he had brought him there himself on purpose, and begged Doctor Cabot to proceed. By his father&rsquo;s directions, the little fellow attempted to climb up on the table, but his legs were too short, and he had to be lifted up. His eye was bandaged, and his head placed upon the pillow. He folded his hands across his breast, turned his eye, did in all things exactly as he was directed, and in half a minute the operation was finished. I do not believe that he changed his position a hair&rsquo;s breadth or moved a muscle. It was an extraordinary instance of fortitude. The spectators were all admiration, and, amid universal congratulation, he was lifted from the table, his eye bound up, and, without a word, but with the spirit of a little hero, he took his father&rsquo;s hand and went away.</i></p><p><i>At this time, amid a press of applicants, a gentleman came to inform us that a young lady was waiting her turn. This gave us an excuse for clearing the room, and we requested all except the medical gentlemen and the immediate friends to favour us with their absence. Such was the strange curiosity these people had for seeing a most disagreeable spectacle, that they were very slow in going away, and some slipped into the other rooms and the yard, but we ferreted them out, and got the room somewhat to ourselves.</i></p><p><i>The young lady was accompanied by her mother. She was full of hesitation and fears, anxious to be relieved, but doubting her ability to endure the pain, and the moment she saw the instruments, her courage entirely forsook her. Doctor Cabot discouraged all who had any distrust of their own fortitude, and, to my mingled joy and regret, she went away.</i></p><p><i>The next in order was the gentleman on whose account we had postponed our departure. He was the oldest general in the Mexican service, but for two years an exile in Merida. By the late revolution, which placed Santa Ana in power, his party was uppermost; and he had strong claims upon our good feelings, for, in a form expatriation from Mexico, he had served as volunteer aid to General Jackson at the battle of New-Orleans. This gentleman had an inward squint in both eyes, which, however, instead of being a defect, gave character to his face; but his sight was injured by it, and this Doctor Cabot thought might be improved. The first eye was cut quickly and successfully, and while the bloody orb was rolling in its socket, the same operation was performed upon the other. In this, however, fearing that the eye “might be drawn too far in the opposite direction, the doctor had not thought it advisable to cut the muscle entirely through, and, on examining it, he was not satisfied with the appearance. The general again laid his head upon the pillow, and the operation was repeated, making three times in rapid succession. Altogether, it was a trying thing, and I felt immensely happy when it was over. With his eyes all right and both bandaged, we carried him to a caleza in waiting, where, to the great amusement of the vagabond boys, he took his seat on the footboard, with his back to the horse, and it was some time before we could get him right.</i></p><p><i>In the mean time, the young lady had returned with her mother. She could not bear to lose the opportunity, and though unable to make up her mind to undergo the operation, she could not keep away. She was about eighteen, of lively imagination, picturing pleasure or pain in the strongest colours, and with a smile ever ready to chase away the tear. At one moment, she roused herself to the effort, and the next, calling herself coward, fell into her mother&rsquo;s arms, while her mother cheered and encouraged her, representing to her, with that confidence allowed before medical men, the advantage it would give her in the eyes of our sex. Her eyes were large, full, and round, and with the tear glistening in them, the defect was hardly visible; in fact, all that they wanted was to be made to roll in the right direction.</i></p><p><i>(&hellip;) it was very different from having to deal with boys or men. It is easy enough to spread out a boy upon a table, but not so with a young lady; so, too, it is easy enough to tie a bandage around a boy&rsquo;s head, but vastly different among combs and curls, and long hair done up behind. As the principal assistant of Doctor Cabot, this complicated business devolved upon me; and having, with the help of her mother, accomplished it, I laid her head upon the pillow as carefully as if it had been my own property. In all the previous cases I had found it necessary, in order to steady my hand, to lean my elbow on the table, and my wrist on the forehead of the patient I did the same with her, and, if I know myself I never gazed into any eyes as I did into that young lady&rsquo;s one eye in particular. When the doctor drew out the instrument, I certainly could have taken her in my arms, but her imagination had been too powerful; her eyes closed, a slight shudder seized her, and she fainted. That passed off, and she rose with her eyes all right. A young gentleman was in attendance to escort her to her home, and the smile had again returned to her cheek as he told her that now her lover would not know her.</i></p><p><i>This case had occupied a great deal of time; the doctor&rsquo;s labours were doubled by the want of regular surgical aid, he was fatigued with the excitement, and I was worn out; my head was actually swimming with visions of bleeding and mutilated eyes, and I almost felt doubtful about my own. The repetition of the operations had not accustomed me to them; indeed, the last was more painful to me than the first, and I felt willing to abandon forever the practice of surgery. Doctor Cabot had explained the modus operandi fully to the medical gentlemen, had offered to procure them instruments, and considering the thing fairly introduced into the country, we determined to stop. But this was not so easy; the crowd out of doors had their opinion on the subject; the biscos considered that we were treating them outrageously, and became as clamorous as a mob in a western city about to administer Lynch law. One would not be kept back. He was a strapping youth, with cast enough in his eye to carry everything before him, and had probably been taunted all his life by merciless schoolboys. Forcing himself inside, with his hands in his pockets, he said that he had the money to pay for it, and would not be put off.

All the afternoon squint-eyed boys were passing up and down the street, throwing slanting glances in at the door, and toward evening, as Mr. Catherwood and I were walking to the plaza, we were hailed by some vagabond urchins with the obstreperous shout, “There go the men who cure the biscos.”</i></p><p>(John L.

Fora alguns tampões ou gazes sobre os olhos daqueles que dividam a sala de espera, não recordo nada em especial que evidenciasse essa debilidade. Mas, ironicamente, a clínica ficava localizada no ponto mais alto da cidade, ao lado de um miradouro de onde se podia contemplar, como em nenhum outro lugar, a melhor vista daquele lugar que carregava no nome o orgulho de seus pontos de vista.</p><p>Não sei por quanto tempo frequentei a clínica, mas ali adquiri, pela primeira vez, uma sensação que me acompanharia por muito tempo: a de que tinha algo errado comigo.  Esta sensação veio a se agravar um pouco depois, quando passei também a frequentar a sala de espera da ludoterapeuta, a quem meus pais acharam que eu deveria visitar depois de sua separação.</p><p>Duas frases da terapeuta, ditas durante essas visitas, unem as experiências das salas de espera: segundo ela, meu estrabismo se atribuía à duplicidade de informações a que eu era submetida por meus pais recém separados: enquanto um dizia sim, o outro dizia não. Que o estrabismo antecedesse em muito a separação dos meus pais parece não tê-la preocupado. E que eu nunca tenha pensado nisso, menos ainda no fato de que meus pais, para minha tristeza, sempre concordavam com tudo, justifica, claro, o fato de eu ter guardado essa memória comigo por tanto tempo.</p><p>O outro episódio tem uma pintura de um pôr do sol no seu centro. Ao ver a pequena tela que eu havia feito, provavelmente com todos os tubos de tinta azul roial que me estavam disponíveis, a terapeuta concluiu que eu sentia falta do meu pai. Achei um disparate sem tamanho: ter um pai separado, e portanto culpado, parecia-me, naquele momento, a coisa mais legal que poderia acontecer a alguém. Mas depois disso, passei a detestar pôres do sol, e acho que minha rejeição à cidade de Belo Horizonte também pode estar relacionada com\nisso.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Lembrança 2: O dia em que finalmente vi meu estrabismo.</b></p><p>O estrabismo é, para mim, uma abstração. Não só nunca me vi estrábica, como não consigo identificar o estrabismo nos outros. Foi apenas quando comecei a ver pintura que de alguma maneira encontrei uma imagem para o estrabismo. Há, por exemplo, alguns autorretratos do Van Gogh nos quais seus olhos apontam para direções ligeiramente diferentes. Em Rembrandt também há isso. Na verdade, nem sempre são as direções do olhar que me chamam a atenção, mas o fato de que um deles parece vivo e focado enquanto que o outro está perdido. É como se um olho encarasse a tela e o outro fosse voltado para dentro – um olho Chardin, talvez.</p><p>Mais tarde, conversando sobre o estrabismo dos pintores com amigos artistas, me disseram que talvez não fosse uma questão de patologia, mas de processo: para fazer um autorretrato, o pintor tem o olho em dois pontos: no espelho e na tela.</p><p>Ver menos é então ver mais: condensam-se espaços e tempos.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Das lembranças para o achado:</b></p><p>Lendo recentemente sobre o Robert Smithson e seu trabalho em Yucatan, encontrei a referência a um viajante americano, John L. Stevens, que, no século XIX, fizera a mesma viagem que Smthison faria 100 anos depois. Stevens viajava acompanhado de um gravurista, responsável por ilustrar a viagem, e um médico, Dr. Cabot. Durante essa expedição, Cabot, com a ajuda de seus companheiros de viagem, performou algumas cirurgias para corrigir o estrabismo da população local e ainda mostrar os novos avanços da medicina àquele povo “atrasado”. Insondada, a menção ao estrabismo a às cirurgias performadas no século XX – que eram feitas sem anestesia, o que a autora, Jennifer L. Roberts, não deixou de notar – parecia justificar-se dentro do quadro que ela montava para Smithson.\nPara ela, Smithson, em especial nos seus trabalhos com espelhos e espelhos enantiomórficos, propunha a reabilitação de uma visão multifocal, em oposição à binocular, que estaria na origem da ilusão de unidade e, por conseguinte, de todo o enquadramento histórico e perceptivo da arte desde o renascimento.</p><p>“Por que não reconstruir a inabilidade de ver?”, pergunta Smithson.</p><p>Mas não é de Smithson que quero te contar, e sim de uma passagem do texto de Roberts, na qual ela tenta associar a literatura médica do século XIX sobre o estrabismo com as impressões de Stephens sobre o “atraso” da mentalidade do povo de Yucatan. Para Stephens a indiferença da população local com os monumentos Maya dava sinais de um atraso em relação aos povos “civilizados”.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Copio aqui um trecho de Roberts:</b></p><p><i>Stephens felt there were more strabics in Yucatan than elsewhere. More importantly however, the etiology of strabismus as discussed in contemporaneous medical treatises featured traits and behaviours\nthat Stephens had already pejoratively attached to the Yucateans. For example, strabismus was strongly associated with mental incapacity because of the the “dullness of look” it produced and the fact that it was often a synmpton of neurological deseases and other cerebral irritations. It also suggested infantilism and lassitude (it was believed that the wandering eye could often be controlled by well disciplined patient willing to make the effort toward proper practice and education. (&hellip;) Consequently, when associated with an indigenous population and implicitly opposed civilized, industrious vision,\nstrabismus could be made to signify not merely a visual disorder but also a cultural one – a culture unable to break out of an indolent parallax and perform the perspective functions of modern industrial civilization; a culture unable to manufacture the necessary perspective to differentiate its foreground from its background, its presente from its past.</i> (Jennifer L. Roberts, Mirror Travels – Robert Smithson and History, p. 94)</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Fui atrás do livro de Stephens e lá não encontrei leitura moral\nassociando o estrabismo à forma como a população de Yucatan percebe a história. Mas encontrei esse relato das cirurgias com o qual me despeço, ainda estrábica.</b></p><p><i>There is no immediate\nconnexion between taking Daguerreotype portraits and the practice of surgery, but circumstances bring close together things entirely dissimilar in themselves, and we went from one to the other. Secluded as Merida is, and seldom\nvisited by strangers, the fame of new discoveries in science is slow in\nreaching it, and the new operation of Mons. Guerin for the cure of strabismus\nhad not been heard of. In private intercourse we had spoken of this operation,\nand, in order to make it known, and extend its benefits, Doctor Cabot had\noffered to perform it in Merida. The Merida people have generally fine eyes,\nbut, either because our attention was particularly directed to it, or that it\nis really the case, there seemed to be more squinting eyes, or biscos, as they\nare called, than are usually seen in any one town, and in Merida, as in some\nother places, this is not esteemed a beauty; but, either from want of\nconfidence in a stranger, or a cheap estimation of the qualifications of a medico\nwho asked no pay for his services, the doctor&rsquo;s philanthropic purposes were not\nappreciated. At least, no one cared to be the first; and as the doctor had no\nsample of his skill with him, no subject offered.</i></p><p><i>We had fixed the day for\nour departure; and the evening but one before, a direct overture was made to\nthe doctor to perform the operation. The subject was a boy, and the application\nin his behalf was made by a gentleman who formed one of a circle in which we\nwere in the habit of visiting, and whom “we were all happy to have it in our\npower to serve”.</i></p><p><i>The time was fixed at ten\no'clock the next day. After breakfast our sala was put in order for the\nreception of company, and the doctor for the first time looked to his\ninstruments. He had some misgivings. They were of very fine workmanship, made\nin Paris, most sensitive to the influence of the atmosphere, and in that\nclimate it was almost impossible to preserve anything metallic from rust. The\ndoctor had packed the case among his clothing in the middle of his trunk, and\nhad taken every possible precaution, but, as usual upon such occasions, the\nmost important instrument had rusted at the point, and in that state was\nutterly useless. There was no cutler in the place, nor any other person\ncompetent to touch it. Mr. Catherwood, however, brought out an old razor hone,\nand between them they worked off the rust.</i></p><p><i>At ten o'clock the doctor&rsquo;s\nsubject made his appearance. He was the son of a widow lady of very respectable\nfamily, about fourteen years old, but small of stature, and presenting even to\nthe most casual glance the stamp of a little gentleman. He had large black\neyes, but, unluckily, their expression was very much injured by an inward\nsquint. With the light heart of boyhood, however, he seemed indifferent to his\npersonal appearance, and came, as he said, because his mother told him to do\nso. His handsome person, and modest and engaging manners, gave us immediately a\nstrong interest in his favour. He was accompanied by the gentleman who had\nspoken of bringing him, Dr. Bado, a Guatimalian educated in Paris, the oldest\nand principal physician of Merida, and by several friends of the family, whom\nwe did not know.</i></p><p><i>Preparations were commenced\nimmediately. The first movement was to bring out a long table near the window;\nthen to spread upon it a mattress and pillow, and upon these to spread the boy.\nUntil the actual moment of operating, the precise character of this new\nbusiness had not presented itself to my mind, and altogether it opened by no\nmeans so favourably as Daguerreotype practice. Not aiming to be technical, but\ndesiring to give the reader the benefit of such scraps of learning as I pick up\nin my travels, modern science has discovered that the eye is retained in its\norbit by six muscles, which pull it up and down, inward and outward, and that\nthe undue contraction of either of these muscles produces that obliquity called\nsquinting, which was once supposed to proceed from convulsions in childhood, or\nother unknown causes. The cure discovered is the cutting of the contracted\nmuscle, by means of which the eye falls immediately into its proper place. This\nmuscle lies under the surface; and, as it is necessary to pass through a\nmembrane of the eye, the cutting cannot be done with a broadaxe or a handsaw.\nIn fact, it requires a knowledge of the anatomy of the eye, manual dexterity,\nfine instruments, and Mr. Catherwood and myself for assistants.</i></p><p><i>Our patient remained\nperfectly quiet, with his little hands folded across his breast; but while the\nknife was cutting through the muscle he gave one groan, so piteous and\nheart-rending, that it sent into the next room all who were not immediately\nengaged. But before the sound of the groan had died away the operation was\nover, and the boy rose with his eye bleeding, but perfectly straight. A bandage\nwas tied over it, and, with a few directions for its treatment, amid the\ncongratulations and praises of all present, and wearing the same smile with\nwhich he had entered, the little fellow walked off to his mother.</i></p><p><i>The news of this wonder\nspread rapidly, and before night Dr. Cabot had numerous and pressing\napplications, among which was one from a gentleman whom we were all desirous to\noblige, and who had this defect in both eyes.</i></p><p><i>On his account we\ndetermined to postpone our departure another day; and, in furtherance of his\noriginal purpose, Dr. Cabot mentioned that he would perform the operation upon\nall who chose to offer. We certainly took no trouble to spread this notice, but\nthe next morning, when we returned from breakfast, there was a gathering of\nsquint-eyed boys around the door, who, with their friends and backers, made a\nformidable appearance, and almost obstructed our entrance. As soon as the door\nopened there was a rush inside; and as some of these slanting eyes might not be\nable to distinguish between meum and tuum, we were obliged to help their\nproprietors out into the street again.</i></p><p><i>At ten o'clock the big\ntable was drawn up to the window, and the mattress and pillow were spread upon\nit, but there was such a gathering around the window that we had to hang up a\nsheet before it. Invitations had been given to Dr. Bado and Dr. Munoz, and all\nphysicians who chose to come, and having met the governor in the evening, I had\nasked him to be present. These all honoured us with their company, together\nwith a number of self-invited persons, who had introduced themselves, and could\nnot well be turned out, making quite a crowded room.</i></p><p><i>The first who presented\nhimself was a stout lad about nineteen or twenty, whom we had never seen or heard\nof before. Who he was or where he came from we did not know, but he was a bisco\nof the worst kind, and seemed able-bodied enough to undergo anything in the way\nof surgery. As soon as the doctor began to cut the muscle, however, our\nstrapping patient gave signs of restlessness; and all at once, with an actual\nbellow, he jerked his head on one side, carried away the doctor&rsquo;s hook, and\nshut his eye upon it with a sort of lockjaw grip, as if determined it should\nnever be drawn out. How my hook got out I have no idea; fortunately, the doctor\nlet his go, or the lad&rsquo;s eye would have been scratched out. As it was, there he\nsat with the bandage slipped above one eye, and the other closed upon the hook,\nthe handle of which stood out straight. Probably at that moment he would have\nbeen willing to sacrifice pride of personal appearance, keep his squint, and go\nthrough life with his eye shut, the hook in it, and the handle sticking out;\nbut the instrument was too valuable to be lost. And it was interesting and\ninstructive to a hook in his eye, and that of lookers-on who had not. All the\nspectators upbraided him with his cowardice and want of heart, and after a\nround of reproof to which he could make no answer, he opened his eye and let\nout the hook. But he had made a bad business of it. A few seconds longer, and\nthe operation would have been completed. As it was, the whole work had to be\nrepeated. As the muscle was again lifted under the knife, I thought I saw a\nglare in the eyeball that gave token of another fling of the head, but the lad\nwas fairly browbeaten into quiet; and, to the great satisfaction of all, with a\ndouble share of blackness and blood, and with very little sympathy from any\none, but with his eye straight, he descended from the table. Outside he was received\nwith a loud shout by the boys, and we never heard of him again.</i></p><p><i>The room was now full of\npeople, and, being already disgusted with the practice of surgery, I sincerely\nhoped that this exhibition would cure all others of a wish to undergo the\noperation, but a little present all the time, crept through the crowd, and,\nreaching the table, squinted up at us without speaking, his crisscross\nexpression telling us very plainly what he wanted. He had on the usual Mestizo\ndress of cotton shirt and drawers and straw hat, and seemed so young, simple,\nand innocent, that we did not consider him capable of judging for himself. We\ntold him he must not be operated on, but he answered, in a decided though\nmodest tone, “Yo quiero, yo quiero,” “I wish it, I wish it.” We inquired if\nthere was any one present who had any authority over him, and a man whom we had\nnot noticed before, dressed, like him, in shirt and drawers, stepped forward\nand said he was the boy&rsquo;s father; he had brought him there himself on purpose,\nand begged Doctor Cabot to proceed. By his father&rsquo;s directions, the little\nfellow attempted to climb up on the table, but his legs were too short, and he\nhad to be lifted up. His eye was bandaged, and his head placed upon the pillow.\nHe folded his hands across his breast, turned his eye, did in all things\nexactly as he was directed, “and in half a minute the operation was finished. I\ndo not believe that he changed his position a hair&rsquo;s breadth or moved a muscle.\nIt was an extraordinary instance of fortitude. The spectators were all\nadmiration, and, amid universal congratulation, he was lifted from the table,\nhis eye bound up, and, without a word, but with the spirit of a little hero, he\ntook his father&rsquo;s hand and went away.</i></p><p><i>At this time, amid a press\nof applicants, a gentleman came to inform us that a young lady was waiting her\nturn. This gave us an excuse for clearing the room, and we requested all except\nthe medical gentlemen and the immediate friends to favour us with their\nabsence. Such was the strange curiosity these people had for seeing a most\ndisagreeable spectacle, that they were very slow in going away, and some\nslipped into the other rooms and the yard, but we ferreted them out, and got\nthe room somewhat to ourselves.</i></p><p><i>The young lady was accompanied\nby her mother. She was full of hesitation and fears, anxious to be relieved,\nbut doubting her ability to endure the pain, and the moment she saw the\ninstruments, her courage entirely forsook her. Doctor Cabot discouraged all who\nhad any distrust of their own fortitude, and, to my mingled joy and regret, she\nwent away.</i></p><p><i>The next in order was the\ngentleman on whose account we had postponed our departure. He was the oldest\ngeneral in the Mexican service, but for two years an exile in Merida. By the\nlate revolution, which placed Santa Ana in power, his party was uppermost; and\nhe had strong claims upon our good feelings, for, in a form expatriation from\nMexico, he had served as volunteer aid to General Jackson at the battle of\nNew-Orleans. This gentleman had an inward squint in both eyes, which, however,\ninstead of being a defect, gave character to his face; but his sight was\ninjured by it, and this Doctor Cabot thought might be improved. The first eye\nwas cut quickly and successfully, and while the bloody orb was rolling in its\nsocket, the same operation was performed upon the other. In this, however,\nfearing that the eye “might be drawn too far in the opposite direction, the\ndoctor had not thought it advisable to cut the muscle entirely through, and, on\nexamining it, he was not satisfied with the appearance. The general again laid\nhis head upon the pillow, and the operation was repeated, making three times in\nrapid succession. Altogether, it was a trying thing, and I felt immensely happy\nwhen it was over. With his eyes all right and both bandaged, we carried him to\na caleza in waiting, where, to the great amusement of the vagabond boys, he\ntook his seat on the footboard, with his back to the horse, and it was some\ntime before we could get him right.</i></p><p><i>In the mean time the young\nlady had returned with her mother. She could not bear to lose the opportunity,\nand though unable to make up her mind to undergo the operation, she could not\nkeep away. She was about eighteen, of lively imagination, picturing pleasure or\npain in the strongest colours, and with a smile ever ready to chase away the\ntear. At one moment she roused herself to the effort, and the next, calling\nherself coward, fell into her mother&rsquo;s arms, while her mother cheered and\nencouraged her, representing to her, with that confidence allowed before\nmedical men, the advantage it would give her in the eyes of our sex. Her eyes\nwere large, full, and round, and with the tear glistening in them, the defect\nwas hardly visible; in fact, all that they wanted was to be made to roll in the\nright direction.</i></p><p><i>(&hellip;) it was very different\nfrom having to deal with boys or men. It is easy enough to spread out a boy\nupon a table, but not so with a young lady; so, too, it is easy enough to tie a\nbandage around a boy&rsquo;s head, but vastly different among combs and curls, and\nlong hair done up behind. As the principal assistant of Doctor Cabot, this\ncomplicated business devolved upon me; and having, with the help of her mother,\naccomplished it, I laid her head upon the pillow as carefully as if it had been\nmy own property. In all the previous cases I had found it necessary, in order\nto steady my hand, to lean my elbow on the table, and my wrist on the forehead\nof the patient I did the same with her, and, if I know myself I never gazed\ninto any eyes as I did into that young lady&rsquo;s one eye in particular. When the\ndoctor drew out the instrument, I certainly could have taken her in my arms,\nbut her imagination had been too powerful; her eyes closed, a slight shudder\nseized her, and she fainted. That passed off, and she rose with her eyes all\nright. A young gentleman was in attendance to escort her to her home, and the\nsmile had again returned to her cheek as he told her that now her lover would\nnot know her.</i></p><p><i>This case had occupied a\ngreat deal of time; the doctor&rsquo;s labours were doubled by the want of regular\nsurgical aid, he was fatigued with the excitement, and I was worn out; my head\nwas actually swimming with visions of bleeding and mutilated eyes, and I almost\nfelt doubtful about my own. The repetition of the operations had not accustomed\nme to them; indeed, the last was more painful to me than the first, and I felt\nwilling to abandon forever the practice of surgery. Doctor Cabot had explained\nthe modus operandi fully to the medical gentlemen, had offered to procure them\ninstruments, and considering the thing fairly introduced into the country, we\ndetermined to stop. But this was not so easy; the crowd out of doors had their\nopinion on the subject; the biscos considered that we were treating them\noutrageously, and became as clamorous as a mob in a western city about to\nadminister Lynch law. One would not be kept back. He was a strapping youth,\nwith cast enough in his eye to carry everything before him, and had probably\nbeen taunted all his life by merciless schoolboys. Forcing himself inside, with\nhis hands in his pockets, he said that he had the money to pay for it, and\nwould not be put off. We were obliged to apologize, and, with a little wish to\nbring him down, gave him some hope that he should be attended to on our return\nto Merida.</i></p><p><i>The news of these successes\nflew like wild-fire, and a great sensation was created throughout the city. All\nthe evening Doctor Cabot was besieged with applications, and I could but think\nhow fleeting is this world&rsquo;s fame! At first my arrival in the country had been\nfairly trumpeted in the newspapers; for a little while Mr. Catherwood had\nthrown me in the shade with the Daguerreotype, and now all our glories were\nswallowed up by Doctor Cabot&rsquo;s cure of strabismus. Nevertheless, his fame was\nreflected upon us. All the afternoon squint-eyed boys were passing up and down\nthe street, throwing slanting glances in at the door, and toward evening, as\nMr. Catherwood and I were walking to the plaza, we were hailed by some vagabond\nurchins with the obstreperous shout, “There go the men who cure the biscos.”</i></p><p>(John L.

            "en": "<p><strong>The elephant and the turtle, the hypothesis and the unknown</strong></p><p>Once upon a time three anchorites were stuck on an island: a Jesuit priest, quite serious and devout; a compulsive Liar, as a matter of fact, a really bad character, but very well-intentioned when it came to the objects of knowledge and spirit; and a third hermit called Mattia, that wasn’t really religious, but due to good sense pretended to believe in the world. The island was divided in three parts, each one had a stone and a fountain, next to each fountain there was a chair, and here and there, amongst the dunes, some tufts of creeping vegetation, some pasture and a reed plot. Besides, the island was a desert, only having at its centre a banana tree around which the three anchorites would gather watching the waves and enjoying the only edible thing on the island, which was of course, bananas. When the sun up high signalled noon, and the sand was so hot it would burn your feet, the Priest, the Liar and Mattia ran to the lonely tree. They would cordially say hello and the three would sit down, facing the sea, in the shade of the banana tree.</p><p>In vain they waited for a sail on the horizon that would take them back to a country where there would be more than three people…, they would tell each other jokes and sighed. Oh, how they sighed! Little by little they started forgetting their past lives, the gospels, the saints and the priests of the holy church, the sadness and, most of all, the joys of life. Between laments they would repeat the mysterious story of their misfortune, the Liar would tell: “My house was the Creator’s palace, just the patio was seventy times seven this joint. On my blessed bed, I would dream every day with Our Lord, and he would say to me: ‘Leave everything behind and go preach to the poor’. One day, I woke up lying on the beach, I heard the din of the waves, and I felt on my body the shiver of salted water. Was I a castaway? What cruelty is this that makes me understand one part but not the other? Not see at once the whole? Have we been here for so long that we have forgotten the meaning of life?” And this way, devoted to misery, the three anchorites would expostulate about theology entertaining each other in the art of conversation like fools do.</p><p>When alone, Mattia would reminisce constantly about that first time in which he experienced the world with his eyes closed and had the impression that an imponderable causality existed that no one else realised. Could that be God? Now he wasn’t sure, but back then he felt that there was something in the world that did not refer to any idea or representation. As a child, everything seemed eternal to Mattia. He would frequently play hide and seek and in one of those games, when having to find his friends that hurried to hide behind bushes and walls, he counted to a hundred, and having finished counting he tried to open his eyes. He tried but couldn’t do it. The sensation gave him a slight unbalance, he felt disoriented. He immediately lost interest in the game. He chose a direction and went straight ahead. Suddenly, the world seemed to embrace Mattia. Stones, plants, walls, the wind, the world seemed to be a profusion of things with no contours that hit him as if they existed for millions of years without ever being truly experienced. All that existed, he imagined, existed before being thought about, before even having been seen. And the gaze, the sense now taken from him temporarily, as it warned men of its surrounding, made the body dodge the world — vision implied the being of things, without really proving their existence.</p><p>Later, when sharing the story with the Liar, he commented with a kind of paternalistic tone: “You know Mattia, there are three things in this life that we can take as certain: first, all that we imagine is true, second, the inverse is most certainly what is most guarantied, third, it is an illusion to consider as true all that we believe in”. Mattia was sensitive to these words, mainly because coming from a liar, they seemed to mean the same as if from a man that only told the truth. In doubt, Mattia wrote on the floor what seemed to be truly what the liar was saying: “You know Mattia, there are three things in this life that we can take as false: first, all that we imagine is a lie, second, the inverse is most certainly even more false, third, it is an illusion to consider as false all that we believe in”. Mattia, now confused, was not feeling sufficiently clarified about the three truths of falsehood. He saw fit, since there was no distinction between true and false, that it was preferable to only believe in the “unknown”. He looked at the waves and to a big bunch of bananas, and thought: “I feel lonely in this island”.</p><p>By suggestion of the Jesuit priest (whose evangelic vocation, so it seemed, was firm), the anchorites started to spend their afternoons finding solutions to very particular scholastic problems. Having in account the circumstances in which they found themselves, the priest chose five small transcendental thoughts related with their collective luck. Those conversations, initially strange, thought Mattia, had at least the virtue of livening up the anchorites that due to doing nothing felt bored and depressed. Somehow it didn’t make sense for them, for instance, to spend their time studying the virtue of morals or the decadence of ethics in modern times. For now, they were indifferent to all that.</p><p>So, <strong>on Mondays</strong>, the vindictive spirit of God was exalted and they talked about the dread of his hand: “supposing that the world was created by a perfect transcendental being and that man was created in the image of God and that, therefore, God has two hands – like man, when initially conceived in the garden of Eden – , which hand of God appears in the Gospel, the left or the right? Finally, which hand of God punished us and placed us on this island?”</p><p><strong>On Tuesdays</strong>, they would refer to the infinite and to the very likely possibility of being on the edge of the world or even over its border: “let’s suppose that we find ourselves, not in the centre of the universe, but indeed, in one of its edges, and that, because of no determination or randomness – like someone that reaches the edge of a cliff without knowing how – we have approached that limit without realizing it. If we jumped to the abyss would we cease to exist? What would we be jumping to? Would we be jumping against a wall? Against the void? Would we jump and not land? Would we jump to a pool?”</p><p><strong>On Wednesdays</strong>, they would inquiry about the several parts of the world and their origins, parts which they would admit didn’t come from God, but from the antithesis of the divine: “in the remote chance of the existence of an absolute and that the world is the intrinsic manifestation of that being, therefore, an occurrence of every attribute of the indivisible, what is the reason for all the diversity apprehended by the senses? Is the centre of the world more like itself and its extremities more prone to difference? What if the earth, like the universe, is round, can we not, at any time, if we wish, be at the end of the world? Is it not, therefore, natural that each point of the world is an extremity in itself, and that God, because he is never the extremity of anything, because he is absolute and indivisible, be only God of itself, and the world, the world of the end of the world or of its own extremity?”</p><p><strong>On Thursdays</strong>, they thought how wonderful it would have been if they had left offspring and how that had also been taken away from them by divine punishment; the famous miff of the homuncule, or of the infinitesimal, like the mathematicians call it: “if it is true that man comes from a woman and that in her uterus a miniscule being is formed until the decent size of a baby, and that that happens not merely by accident, but because a seed is placed there by someone entitled to it (or by someone careless) – who is that small man, so tiny, that is in turn inside the man-breeder and which seems to fertilize the woman in the same way God has fertilized the world? Is it God again? God as a miniature? In the end, is it the homuncule of God that fertilizes women or is it men?”</p><p><strong>On Fridays</strong>, they would talk about purpose and love: “if we consider as convincing the argument that the purpose of life is to be happy and if we only have a short time to make that major accomplishment happen and, also, if popular knowledge is right when it says that ‘no one could be happy by living by himself’, so what are we doing in this island at all? Are we perchance forbidden of being happy?; and then, “considering false the preconception that love between a man and a woman is the way in which we conquer happiness and if, for the ascetic, the love of God is more than enough to face celibacy, why is it so hard to look at the world and not see but the shapes that remind us of the body of a woman? Is the earth so generous that it concedes to every dune and valley the sensual vision of the <em>mons veneris</em>? And the inverse: if every time we are dreaming of women, are we dreaming about the world?”</p><p><strong>On Saturdays</strong> they didn’t discuss anything;</p><p><strong>And on Sundays</strong>, they would revise the conclusions they had reached the week before.</p><p>Well, on a certain Sunday, while the priest corrected Monday’s argument: “If it is possible that God exists and that he has hands, we can only consider as true the proposition that God is ambidextrous. Because if God is the ‘absolute reason in which all otherness is unity’, where left is right and the inverse at the same time, as the argument of the synthesis of opposites proves – if on one side God is movement on the other side that movement is also its resting – so, there is no reason for God to prefer one hand to the other”. Mattia, tired of so much super-sensitive, dedicated some time analysing introspectively the pertinence of Diderot’s objection: “Ask a priest why does the world remain suspended in the air and he will answer that it is carried on the back of a white elephant. If next we ask a Liar, on what is the elephant leaning on, he will say: on a turtle, and the turtle who will carry it?”…<br>For that, Mattia had no answer, “but at least”, he thought, “spare me the elephant and the turtle”.</p><p>Mattia didn’t know what held the world, but he didn’t think that there were elephants sufficiently big to carry planets, in the same way there were no turtles that gigantic to carry planetary elephants. However, hypothetically arriving to such conclusion, maybe one can, after having found the support of the turtle, suppress the two animals. He called this: “the unknown!”.</p><p>Well, one day, sitting under the banana tree, this time in silence, they saw from a distance, on the other side of the island, a monkey. The Liar notice him first: “Colleagues, if I am not very much mistaken, that figure in the dunes is a woman”. The priest exalted: “It’s true! It’s a Miracle! Before such present from God we can and we should do without the sacred vow of chastity”. The other two anchorites thought the same and were already imagining the sweet caress of the motherly lap of a woman and the consolation of a night of lust.<br>Immediately the priest, remembering the monogamous imperative, proposed: “In this island there are three men, but from heaven we only got one woman. As the Gospel says: Fortune smiles upon the deserving. Let’s do this: whoever catches her, gets to keep her!” And they went after the monkey. Since the island was deserted and there were not many places to hide, when the scared monkey saw the three hermits in pursuit, he ran to a plot of reeds. Without blinking, the anchorites threw themselves at the bushes. In the midst of that maze, Mattia, used not to trust his vision, looked for other clues in his quest. Raising his nose, Mattia sensed an unknown musky smell and ventures that way, where his flair takes him. And soon he reached the monkey who was bathing like a Roman goddess in the fountain. That sensual vision is overwhelming and Mattia jumps, struggles and finally immobilizes the monkey. He then notices that Aphrodite has hair. The Liar arrives and full of envy says: “it’s not hair, it’s feathers!” the priest confirms and concludes: “Obviously, if she has fallen from the sky, the woman can fly. It’s an angel!” The monkey says: “Uga! Uga!” and Mattia, sensing the beast’s horrible breath, is suspicious that the monkey might not be what so much liturgy suggested it was. “But where is the white feminine complexion?” he asked, “Where is the fertile hip in the shape of a pear? The swollen nipples of my dreams? Where are the robust buttocks of my mother? If this is what I feel it is – a gorilla –, so the woman must be the “unknown”! But if for you this monkey with feathers came from the sky, then it is natural that you would be content with other animals and there are many turtles and elephants around.”</p>",
            "pt": "<p><b>O elefante e a tartaruga, a hipótese e o ignoto</b><br/></p><p>Era uma vez três anacoretas que se encontravam\npresos numa ilha: um Padre Jesuíta, deveras sério e piedoso; um Mentiroso\ncompulsivo, por sinal, bastante mau carácter, mas mui bem-intencionado no que\ndiz respeito aos objectos do saber e do espírito; e um terceiro eremitão\nchamado Mattia, que não era propriamente religioso, mas que por bom senso\nfingia acreditar no mundo. A ilha estava dividida em três partes, cada parte\ntinha uma pedra e uma fonte, ao lado de cada fonte havia uma cadeira, e aqui e\nali, por entre as dunas, espreitavam tufos de vegetação rasteira, algum pasto e\ncanavial. De resto, a ilha era um deserto, havendo apenas no centro uma bananeira\nà volta da qual os três anacoretas se reuniam observando as ondas e apreciando\na única coisa comestível na ilha, claro está, bananas. Quando o sol, lá no alto\nsinalizava o meio-dia, e a areia de tão quente queimava os pés, o Padre, o\nMentiroso e o Mattia corriam para a árvore solitária. Cumprimentavam-se\ncordialmente e sentavam-se os três, virados para o mar, à sombra da bananeira. Em\nvão aguardavam por uma vela no horizonte que os devolvesse a um país onde\nhouvesse mais de três pessoas&hellip;, contavam anedotas uns aos outros e\nsuspiravam. Ui, se suspiravam! Aos poucos iam-se esquecendo das vidas passadas,\ndos evangelhos, dos santos e padres da santa igreja, das tristezas e sobretudo\ndas alegrias da vida. Entre lamentos repetiam a história misteriosa do seu\ninfortúnio, contava o Mentiroso: “A minha casa era o palácio do Criador, só o\npátio era setenta vezes sete esta chafarica. Na minha cama, abençoada seja,\nsonhava todos os dias com Nosso Senhor, El’dizia-me: ‘Larga tudo e vai\ncatequizar os pobrezinhos’. Certo dia, acordei estendido na praia, ouvi o\nrestolho das ondas, e senti no corpo o arrepio da água salgada. Seria um náufrago?\nQue crueldade é esta que me faz apenas compreender uma parte e não a outra? Não\nver de uma só vez o todo? Será que estamos aqui há tanto tempo que nos\nesquecemos do sentido da vida?”  E assim,\ndevotados à miséria, os três anacoretas parlamentavam sobre teologia entretendo-se\nuns aos outros na arte da conversa como fazem os parvos.<br/></p><p>Mattia, quando estava sozinho, recordava-se amiúde\ndessa primeira vez em que experimentou o mundo de olhos fechados e teve a\nimpressão de que existia uma causalidade imponderável de que mais ninguém se\napercebia. Seria Deus? Agora não estava seguro, mas sentia que no mundo havia\nalgo que não se referia a qualquer ideia ou representação. Seria ainda criança e\npor ser novo tudo lhe parecia eterno. Brincava frequentemente às escondidas e\nnum desses jogos, tendo ele que encontrar os amigos que apressadamente se escondiam\nnos arbustos e atrás dos muros, contou até cem, e tendo acabado a contagem\ntentou abrir os olhos. Tentou e não conseguiu. A sensação dava-lhe um ligeiro desequilíbrio,\nsentia-se desorientado. Perdeu imediatamente o interesse pelo jogo, escolheu\numa direcção e seguiu em frente. De repente, o mundo pareceu ir ao encontro de\nMattia. Pedras, plantas, paredes, o vento, o mundo parecia-lhe uma profusão de\ncoisas sem contornos que chocavam contra ele como se existissem há milhões de\nanos sem nunca terem sido experimentadas verdadeiramente. Tudo o que existia,\nimaginava ele, existia antes de ser pensado, antes sequer de ser visto. E o olhar,\nsentido do qual se via temporariamente privado, por prevenir o entendimento do\nque circundava o homem, fazia o corpo desviar-se do mundo — a visão presumia o\nser das coisas sem de facto provar que as coisas existiam.</p><p>Mais tarde, ao partilhar a história com o\nMentiroso, este comentou com um certo paternalismo: “Sabes Mattia, há três\ncoisas nesta vida que podemos dar como certas: primeiro, tudo o que imaginamos\né verdade, segundo, o inverso é com certeza mais garantido, terceiro, é ilusório\nconsiderar como verdadeiro tudo aquilo em que acreditamos”. Mattia ficou muito sensibilizado\npor estas palavras, sobretudo porque, vindas de um mentiroso, pareciam querer\ndizer o mesmo que vindas de um homem que só diz a verdade. Na dúvida, Mattia escreveu\nno chão aquilo que parecia ser o que genuinamente o Mentiroso dizia: “Sabes\nMattia, há três coisas nesta vida que podemos dar como falsas: primeiro, tudo\naquilo que imaginamos é mentira, segundo, o inverso é com certeza mais falso\nainda, terceiro, é ilusório considerar como falso tudo aquilo em que\nacreditamos”. Mattia, agora confuso, não se sentia suficientemente esclarecido\nsobre as três verdades da mentira. Achou por bem, já que não havia qualquer\ndistinção entre a verdade e a mentira, ser preferível só acreditar no “ignoto”.\nOlhou para as ondas e para um cacho bem grande de bananas, e pensou: “Sinto-me\nsozinho nesta ilha.”  </p><p>Por sugestão do Padre Jesuíta (cuja vocação evangélica,\npelos vistos, mantinha-se firme), os anacoretas passaram a dedicar as suas\ntardes a solucionar problemas escolásticos muito particulares. Tendo em conta a\ncircunstância em que se encontravam, o Padre escolheu cinco pequenas reflexões transcendentais\nrelacionadas com a sua sorte colectiva. Essas conversas, inicialmente\nestranhas, pensava Mattia, tinham pelo menos a virtude de animar os anacoretas no\ndegredo, que por não fazerem nada se sentiam aborrecidos e deprimidos. Dessa\nforma, não lhes fazia sentido, por exemplo, perderem o tempo a estudar a\nvirtude da moral ou a decadência da ética nos tempos modernos. Tudo isso era\nindiferente por agora. </p><p>Então, <b>às segundas-feiras, </b>enalteciam o\nespírito vingativo de Deus e conversavam sobre o temor da sua mão: “admitindo\nque o mundo foi criado por um ser transcendental perfeito e que o homem é criado\nà imagem de Deus e que, por conseguinte, Deus tem duas mãos — como o homem,\nquando inicialmente concebido no jardim do Éden —, qual\né a mão de Deus que aparece no Evangelho, a esquerda ou a direita? Finalmente,\nqual foi a mão de Deus que nos castigou e nos pôs nesta ilha?”</p><p> <b>Às terças</b>, referiam-se ao limite\ndo infinito e à possibilidade bem verosímil de estarem na borda do mundo ou até\npara além da sua margem: “suponhamos que nos encontramos, não no centro do\nuniverso, mas efectivamente, numa das pontas, e que, por uma indeterminação ou\nacaso — assim como quem se acerca de um precipício e não se dá conta— nos\naproximávamos desse limite sem saber. Será que se saltássemos para esse abismo\ndeixaríamos de existir? Saltávamos contra o quê afinal? Saltávamos contra uma\nparede? Contra o nada? Saltávamos e não aterrávamos? Saltávamos para uma\npiscina?”</p><p>Às <b>quartas, </b>questionavam acerca das\nvárias partes do mundo e da sua origem, que admitiam não porvir de Deus, mas da\nantítese do divino: “na hipótese remota de haver um absoluto e de o mundo ser a\nmanifestação intrínseca desse ser, por conseguinte, decorrente de todos os\natributos do indivisível, qual a razão de toda a diversidade percebida pelos\nsentidos? Será o centro do mundo mais igual a si próprio e as extremidades do\nmundo mais propensas à diferença? E se a Terra, como o universo, for redonda,\nnão poderemos então estar sempre que desejarmos no fim do mundo? Não será,\nportanto, natural que cada ponto do mundo seja uma extremidade em si, e que\nDeus por nunca ser extremidade de nada, porque é absoluto e indivisível, ser só\nDeus de si próprio e o mundo ser mundo do fim-do-mundo ou da sua própria\nextremidade?”</p><p><b>Às quintas</b>, pensavam como seria\nbom terem deixado uma descendência e como também isso lhes tinha sido negado\npor castigo divino; a célebre questiúncula do homúnculo, ou do infinitesimal\ncomo lhe chamam os matemáticos: “se é verdade que o homem nasce da mulher e que\nno seu útero se desenvolve um ser minúsculo até ao tamanho decente de um bebé, e\nque tal acontece não por mero acaso, mas porque a semente é lá posta por quem\nde direito (ou por quem foi descuidado), que homem é esse tão pequeno, tão pequenino,\nque por sua vez está dentro do homem sementeiro e que parece fecundar a mulher da\nmesma forma como Deus fecundou o mundo? É Deus outra vez? Deus miniaturizado? Por\nfim pergunta-se, será o homúnculo de Deus que fecunda a mulher ou é o homem?”</p><p><b>Às sextas</b>, falavam acerca da\nfinalidade e do amor: “se considerarmos como convincente o argumento de que a\nfinalidade da vida é ser-se feliz e se apenas dispomos de um tempo curto para\nrealizar esse feito máximo e, também, se a sabedoria popular tem razão quando\ndiz que “não se é feliz sozinho”, o que fazemos então aqui nesta ilha? Estamos\npor acaso interditos de ser felizes?”; e depois, “considerando falso o\npreconceito de que o amor entre o homem e a mulher é a maneira pela qual se\nconquista a felicidade e se para o asceta o amor a Deus é perfeitamente\nsuficiente para encarar o celibato, porque nos custa tanto olhar para o mundo e\nnão ver senão todas as formas que nos lembram o corpo da mulher? Será que a\nterra é tão generosa que concede a todas as dunas e vales a visão sensual do\nmonte de Vénus? E o inverso: será que sempre que sonhamos com mulheres estamos\na sonhar com o mundo?”</p><p><b>Ao sábado </b>não discutiam nada;</p><p><b>E ao domingo, </b>reviam as\nconclusões a que tinham chegado na semana anterior.</p><p>Ora certo\ndomingo, enquanto o Padre corrigia o argumento de segunda-feira: “Se for\npossível que Deus exista e que tenha mãos, apenas podemos considerar como\nverdadeira a proposição de que ele é ambidestro. Porque se Deus é a ‘razão\nabsoluta na qual toda a alteridade é unidade’, onde o esquerdo é o direito e o\ninverso ao mesmo tempo, como aliás prova o argumento da síntese dos opostos — se\npor um lado Deus é o movimento por outro lado também esse movimento é o seu repouso\n— então, não há razão nenhuma para Deus preferir uma mão à outra”. Mattia, cansado\nde tanto supra-sensível, dedicava algum tempo a analisar introspectivamente a\npertinência da objecção de Diderot: “Perguntai a um Padre porque é que o mundo\npermanece suspenso no ar e responder-vos-á que é carregado no dorso de um elefante\nbranco. Se perguntarmos a seguir a um Mentiroso, em que é que o elefante está\napoiado, ele dirá: numa tartaruga; e a tartaruga quem a sustentará?&hellip;”</p><p>Para isso, Mattia não tinha resposta, “mas ao\nmenos”, pensava ele, “poupai-me ao elefante e à tartaruga.”</p><p>Mattia não sabia o que suspendia o mundo, mas\nnão achava que houvessem elefantes suficientemente grandes para carregar\nplanetas, assim como não haveriam tartarugas de tal ordem gigantescas para\ntransportar elefantes planetários. Porém, aqui chegados hipoteticamente, talvez\nse possa, depois de encontrado o apoio da tartaruga, suprimir os dois animais.\nChamou a isso: “o ignoto!”   </p><p>Ora um dia, sentados debaixo da árvore das\nbananas, desta feita em silêncio, avistaram ao longe, na outra parte da ilha,\num macaco. O Mentiroso viu-o primeiro: “Colegas, se não me engano, aquele vulto\nnas dunas é uma mulher”. O Padre exaltou: “De verdade! É Milagre! Perante tal\npresente de Deus pode e deve-se prescindir do voto sagrado de castidade.” Os\noutros dois anacoretas supunham da mesma forma e já imaginavam o doce carinho\nmaterno do colo de uma mulher e o consolo de uma noite de volúpia. Imediatamente\no Padre, lembrando-se do imperativo monogâmico, propôs: “Nesta ilha existem\ntrês homens, mas do céu apareceu-nos apenas uma mulher. Como diz o evangelho: a\nsorte sorri a quem a merece. Combinemos assim: quem a apanhar fica com ela!” E partiram\natrás do macaco. Uma vez que a ilha era deserta e não havia muitos sítios por\nonde se esconder, o macaco assustado, ao ver os três eremitas no seu encalço, foge\npor um caniçal. Sem pensarem três vezes os anacoretas atiram-se ao mato. No\nmeio desse emaranhado, Mattia, habituado a não confiar na visão, procurou\noutras pistas da sua caça. Levantando o nariz, Mattia intui um aroma almiscarado\ndesconhecido e aventura-se por aí, por onde o faro o leva. Vai logo descobrir o\nmacaco como uma deusa romana a banhar-se na fonte. Essa visão sensual é\narrebatadora e Mattia salta, luta e finalmente imobiliza o macaco. Repara então\nque a Afrodite tem pêlos. Chega o Mentiroso cheio de inveja e diz: “não são pêlos,\nsão penas!” e o Padre confirma e conclui: “Obviamente, se caiu do céu, a mulher\nsabe voar. É um Anjo!”. O macaco diz: “Uga! Uga!” e Mattia, ao sentir o hálito\ndesagradável da besta, desconfia se aquele macaco é, ou não, aquilo que tanta liturgia\nsugeria que fosse. “Mas onde está a tez branca feminina?” pergunta-se, “Que é\nfeito do quadril fértil em forma de pêra? Os mamilos intumescidos dos meus\nsonhos? Onde estão as nádegas robustas da minha mãe? Se isto é aquilo que sinto\nque é — um gorila —, então a mulher deve ser o ‘ignoto’! Mas se para vocês este\nmacaco com penas veio do céu, então é natural que se contentem com outros\nanimais e há por aí muitas tartarugas e elefantes”.</p>"
